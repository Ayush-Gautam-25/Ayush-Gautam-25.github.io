# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Ayush Gautam**, an Independant AI researcher focused on architectural, training and interpretation aspects of different Foundational Models.

---

## 🔍 Interests
- **Foundational Model Architectures:** Exploring transformer-based and modular designs that improve capability and scalability
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):** Studying sparse expert models, dynamic routing strategies, and load balancing to scale models efficiently.
- **Reinforcement Learning in AI Systems:** Leveraging RL to enhance decision-making, planning, and coordination in LLM-based agents — including multi-agent reasoning, tool use, and long-horizon behavior optimization.
- **Finetuning techniques:** LoRA, QLoRA, Preference optimization techniques
- **Efficiency Engineering:** Delving into parallelism, quantization, and memory optimization for low-cost LLM deployment and training.
- **Scaling Laws & Training Efficiency:** Investigating data–model–compute trade-offs and how to train LLMs with fewer tokens and lower compute without sacrificing performance.
