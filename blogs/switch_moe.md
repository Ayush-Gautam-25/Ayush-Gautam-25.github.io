# Switch Transformer: Efficient LLM Scaling via Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

> This blog will explore how Switch Transformer, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, enables us to scale large language models while keeping computation per token low.

---

## 🚀 Why This Topic?

Dense models scale poorly in terms of compute. Sparse MoE models like Switch Transformer route only a subset of the model (e.g., top-1 expert) per token, allowing larger models to be trained and deployed more efficiently.

## 📌 Coming Up:

- How MoE works and what makes it efficient
- Switch vs GShard vs Base Layer vs Top-K routing
- How gating, expert dropout, and load balancing affect performance
- Training a small-scale Switch Transformer on domain data
- Evaluating compute savings, accuracy, and memory usage

Stay tuned!
